# Code of Conduct

LOPHOS is an open, collaborative project. We expect everyone interacting in project spaces to help maintain a safe, inclusive, and professional environment.

## Our Pledge

We, as maintainers and contributors, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that creates a positive environment include:**

* Showing empathy and kindness to other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for users and the community
* Acknowledging and celebrating contributions

**Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**

* Harassment, insults, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks
* Trolling, deliberate disruption, or repeatedly derailing discussions
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional academic setting

## Scope

This Code applies to all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, commits, reviews, documentation, chat) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards, and may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

* Prefer a **private report** via GitHub (confidential issue/discussion), or
* Contact the maintainers through institutional channels associated with the supervisors.

**Primary contacts:**

* Maintainer: **Pranjul Mishra**
* Scientific guidance: **Dr. Joanna Borkowska** and **Prof. Dariusz Plewczyński** (Structural and Functional Genomics Laboratory)

We will respect confidentiality, review incidents promptly, and communicate outcomes as appropriate.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they deem necessary and appropriate. Possible consequences include, but are not limited to:

1. **Correction** — A private, written notice clarifying expected behavior.
2. **Warning** — A formal warning; further incidents may result in temporary restrictions.
3. **Temporary restriction** — Temporary limitations on participation (e.g., PR/issue privileges) for a defined period.
4. **Permanent restriction** — Permanent removal from project spaces and/or revocation of repository access.

Appeals may be directed to the maintainers and will be reviewed by at least two people (maintainer and one supervisor when available).

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from widely used open‑source community guidelines and is inspired by the spirit of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
